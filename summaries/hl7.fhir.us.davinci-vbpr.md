The Da Vinci Value-Based Performance Reporting (VBPR) FHIR Implementation Guide is a standard way for health insurers and providers to exchange digital reports on how well providers are performing under value-based contracts. It makes it easy to share, understand, and compare scores for quality, cost, and other goals so everyone knows where they stand and what to work on. By using one common format, payers and providers can track progress, earn incentives, and improve care together.
